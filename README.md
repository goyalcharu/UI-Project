## OBJECTIVE
The project's goal is to create a website that allows users to purchase things from an existing store. To construct such a website, comprehensive web support must be given. The primary goal of the project is to create a full and functional web application that can deliver an online shopping experience.
It also helps us comprehend the notion of user-integrated graphics and how JavaScript may be inserted in HTML. It also explains how the client-side language interacts with the server-side language as well as the database. This shopping cart application is quite adaptable and may be improved by adding more functionality and changing the aesthetics for commercial usage.

The database has been developed using SQL, phpMyAdmin (version 5.1.3) and Xampp server. We have created a table by the name of ‘checkout_info’ which has been created for the ‘Checkout’ web page of the website which takes the customer’s information and saves it in the database. This web page asks the customer to input his/her general information such as his/her name, email id, mobile number, address, country, city, state, zip code. We have set ‘id’ as the primary key in the database.

## APPLICATION
The application of this website is to help the owner of the small business “ Artwork by Yuktaa”, a platform where the owner of the franchise, Ms. Yuktaa Malik can put all the products she makes. 
It is important for small businesses to provide a platform wherein customers can view all the products available. As Miss Yuktaa had an Instagram store which provided limited scope to the users in terms of looking for reviews or searching for particular products it became extremely crucial for her to create a website for her brand.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We were successfully able to create a website for the small business “Artwork by Yuktaa”  as a team. The website can be used for any Ecommerce brand. It is easy to use, since it uses CSS and Javascript which makes the website more attractive and effective. User friendly screens are provided. The website is easy to use and interactive making online shopping a recreational activity for users. The web design has been presented to Ms. Yuktaa as well who liked the overall working and creatives of the website.
